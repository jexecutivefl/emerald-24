            <p>We've mentioned this a few times in passing but it's often helpful to find the topic upfront in the blog. So - whether you're a seasoned cardholder or looking to renew your Florida medical marijuana card for the first time, here's what you need to know.</p>
            <p>Understanding the renewal process is key to maintaining uninterrupted access to the therapeutic benefits of medical marijuana.

Keep track of it to avoid any disruptions in your access to medical marijuana. The <a href="https://mmuregistry.flhealth.gov/" target="_blank">OMMU</a> recommends initiating the renewal process well before your card expires to ensure you receive your renewed card in a timely manner.</p>
            <p>You can start the process to renew your Florida medical marijuana card up to 45 days before its expiration. Do I Have to See a Doctor Again for a Medical Marijuana Card Renewal in Florida? Yes. In Florida, patients have to have their eligibility for low-THC cannabis reassessed by their designated physician every 210 days. This is also known as a re-certification appointment. While the initial certification visit must be in person, since May 2023, the follow-up re-certification appointments can also take place online via telehealth.</p>
